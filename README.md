# STAT545B - Assignment B-3 and Assignment 4

This repo holds my shinny app for STAT545B - Assignment B-3 and Assignment 4
<br><br>
For Assignment 3
I chose Option A - BC Liquor app and made the application more UI/UX friendly by changing the background theme and adding a UBC logo in the title to acknolwedge our developers' contribution. Also, we included a new feature to sort the alcohol data by alcoholic content, which helps customers to find the best alcohol that suits their needs the best.
<br><br>
For Assignment 4
I chose Option C - Shinny App. I made some more improvements based on the Shinny app I made in assignment B-3, including adding an external css, a new plot and a download button.
<br><br>
Version for Assignment 3: I deployed my app at https://terrykwan.shinyapps.io/BC_Liquor/ <br>
Version for Assignment 4: I deployed my app at https://terrykwan.shinyapps.io/BC_Liquor_Assignment_4/

### Features

For Assignment 3:

1. Changed the background theme to "darkly", which is a dark mode and friendly to your eyes.

2. Allow users to sort the alcohol data by alcoholic content, for better UX.

3. Added a UBC logo on the title, so that people know who developed this shinny app.

For Assignment 4:

4. Added a special font using an external css, which helps make our webpage a bit nicer

5. Added a static plot to allow users to view how many alcohol we have according to different alcohol types, which gives them a general overview about our current stock.

6. Allow user to export/download the dataset in CSV format so that they can process it on Excel.
