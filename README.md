# STAT545B - Assignment B-3

This repo holds my shinny app for STAT545B - Assignment B-3
<br>
I chose Option A - BC Liquor app and made the application more UI/UX friendly by changing the background theme and adding a UBC logo in the title to acknolwedge our developers' contribution. Also, we included a new feature to sort the alcohol data by alcoholic content, which helps customers to find the best alcohol that suits their needs the best.

I deployed my app at https://terrykwan.shinyapps.io/BC_Liquor/

### Features

1. Changed the background theme to "darkly", which is a dark mode and friendly to your eyes.

2. Allow users to sort the alcohol data by alcoholic content, for better UX.

3. Added a UBC logo on the title, so that people know who developed this shinny app.
